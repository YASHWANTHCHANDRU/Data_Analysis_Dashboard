# Banking Transaction Report(Interactive dashboard created using Power BI)
## Project Objective
This dataset contains 20,000 enriched financial transactions across products like checking accounts, loans, mortgages, and card payments. Each record is embedded with detailed attributes such as:

- Customer income brackets and credit scores
- Transaction types, fees, and amounts

- Segment classification and recommended financial offers

- The goal is to extract patterns, segment behaviors, and revenue drivers that banks use to:
- Improve personalization
- Assess customer risk and profitability
- Refine marketing campaigns
- Optimize branch and channel performance
